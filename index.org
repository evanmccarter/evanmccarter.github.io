* Why this website
I made this website to:
  1. Learn org mode
     
     Org mode is a powerful note-taking markdown language. 
     A markdown language combined with Git and a logical folder structure means always being able to find your notes. 
  2. Collect contact information
     
     I get to list all the contact information I want to share in one place
  3. Compile resources
     
     I get to share resources and research that I do on my own with others
