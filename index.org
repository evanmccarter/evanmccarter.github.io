** Career goals
   1. Enable people to direct and control their computing environment
   2. Enable people to communicate with their neighbors more effectively and efficiently

* Org Files
  These pages are also available as .org files for Emacs. Simply replace the trailing .html portion of the filename with .org
* Why I made this site
I made this site to:
  1. Learn org mode
     
     [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] is a powerful note-taking markdown language. 
     A markdown language combined with Git and a logical folder structure means always being able to find your notes. 
  2. Collect contact information
     
     I get to list all the contact information I want to share in one place
  3. Compile resources
     
     I get to share resources and research that I do on my own with others
