* Credit
  Credit is based off your main credit report, which details all your open accounts and recent blemishes. 
  If your credit report looks good, you'll likely have a good credit score as well. 
  
  It's free and harmless to check your credit report and your credit score. You are encouraged to and should do so periodically to measure your progress and correct errors. 
  You can request your credit report from each of the three major credit agencies through [[https://annualcreditreport.com][annualcreditreport.com]] or each agency's resources. 
  Credit card issuers will often give you a free credit score every few months, since they check themselves anyway!
