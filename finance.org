* Credit
  "[[https://YouTube.com/watch?v%3DDyV0OfU3-FU&list%3DPLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc&index%3D1][Gold is money]]. Everything [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v%3DCxHarNKW7Go][else]] is [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v%3DPHe0bXAIuk0][credit]]." - J. P. Morgan
  
  Credit can multiply your spending, which can allow you to buy assets sooner but always creates a liability for yourself. 
  If you buy a poor asset or just increase your spending, debt you incurred will still be there to drain your wealth from you. 
  
  Credit is based off your main credit report, which details all your open accounts & recent blemishes. 
  If your credit report looks good, you'll likely have a good credit score as well. 
  
  It's free & harmless to check your credit report & your credit score. You are encouraged to & should do so periodically to measure your progress & correct errors. 
  You can request your credit report from each of the three major credit agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) through [[https://annualcreditreport.com][annualcreditreport.com]] or each agency's resources. 
  Credit card issuers will often give you a free credit score every few months, since they check themselves anyway!
