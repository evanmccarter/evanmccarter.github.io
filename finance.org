* Credit
  "[[https://YouTube.com/watch?v%3DDyV0OfU3-FU&list%3DPLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc&index%3D1][Gold is money]]. Everything [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v%3DCxHarNKW7Go][else]] is [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v%3DPHe0bXAIuk0][credit]]." - J. P. Morgan
  
  Credit can multiply your spending, which can allow you to buy assets sooner but always creates a liability for yourself. 
  If you buy a poor asset or just increase your expenses, debt you incurred will still be a liability to drain your wealth from you. 
  
  Credit is based off your main credit report, which details all your open accounts & recent blemishes. 
  If your credit report looks good, you'll likely have a good credit score as well. 
  
  It's free & harmless to check your credit report & your credit score. You are encouraged to & should do so periodically to measure your progress & correct errors. 
  You can request your credit report from each of the three major credit agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) through [[https://annualcreditreport.com][annualcreditreport.com]] or each agency's resources. 
  Credit card issuers will often give you a free credit score every few months, since they check themselves anyway! 
  
  See the [[https://myfico.com][myFico]] links in [[Research]] for more information & sources
  
  See [[https://creditwise.capitalone.com][Credit Wise from Capital One]], [[https://Nerdwallet.com][Nerdwallet]], or some [[YouTube%20Channels][YouTube Channels]] for credit card advice
** Credit tracking
   You can use these sites to estimate your credit score in order to gauge when to apply for a better credit card while you're beginning to build credit. 
   However, these sites usually show a [[https://vantagescore.com][Vantage Score]] rather than a [[https://myfico.com][FICO]] [[https://ficoscore.com][score]], which weight categories differently, and most lenders use FICO scores. 
   Therefore, these free scores are *only estimates*. 
   After building good credit, the main factor in improving credit is time, but these sites also track and graph your credit score over time.

** Credit cards
*** Issuer limits
    Some credit card companies won't issue credit cards to you if you have too many from other issuers or in too short a time frame
**** J. P. Morgan Chase
    Chase will only issue credit cards to people with less than 5 new credit cards in the past 24 months. 
    Therefore, others recommend getting enough credit to gain Chase's trust and then 
    apply for your desired Chase cards before applying for other credit cards. 
**** Premium companies
     Companies such as Barclays supposedly won't issue credit cards to you if you have too many total credit cards
**** American Express
     American Express supposedly limits the total number of cards you can have from them, [[https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/maximum-number-of-american-express-cards-you-can-have/][but this may have changed]]
