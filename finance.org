* Credit
  "[[https://YouTube.com/watch?v=DyV0OfU3-FU&list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc&index=1][Gold is money]]. Everything [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v=CxHarNKW7Go][else]] is [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0][credit]]." - J. P. Morgan

  Money maintains or increases its value (to you) over time, whereas currency is a medium of exchange but decreases in value over time. 

  We live in an era where credit is available in huge quantities for almost everyone and almost every institution. 

  Credit can multiply your spending, which can allow you to buy assets sooner but always creates a liability for yourself. 
  If you buy a poor asset or just increase your expenses, debt you incurred will still be a liability to drain your wealth from you. 

  Credit is based off your main credit report, which details all your open accounts & recent blemishes. 
  If your credit report looks good, you'll likely have a good credit score as well. 

  It's free & harmless to check your credit report & your credit score. You are encouraged to & should do so periodically to measure your progress & correct errors. 
  You can request your credit report from each of the three major credit agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) through [[https://annualcreditreport.com][annualcreditreport.com]] or each agency's resources. 
  Credit card issuers will often give you a free credit score every few months, since they check themselves anyway! 

  See the [[https://myfico.com][myFico]] links in [[Research]] for more information & sources

  See [[https://creditwise.capitalone.com][Credit Wise from Capital One]], [[https://Nerdwallet.com][Nerdwallet]], or some YouTube Channels for credit card advice
** Credit tracking
   You can use these sites to estimate your credit score in order to gauge when to apply for a better credit card while you're beginning to build credit. 
   However, these sites usually show a [[https://vantagescore.com][Vantage Score]] rather than a [[https://myfico.com][FICO]] [[https://ficoscore.com][score]], which weight categories differently, and most lenders use FICO scores. 
   Therefore, these free scores are *only estimates*. 
   After building good credit, the main factor in improving credit is time, but these sites also track and graph your credit score over time. 
   - [[https://nerdwallet.com/home/dashboard/credit-score][Nerdwallet]]

   - [[https://creditwise.capitalone.com][Credit Wise from Capital One]]
   - [[https://creditsesame.com][Credit Sesame]]
   - [[https://freecreditscore.com][FreeCreditScore.com]] (shows FICO score for free, but annoyingly pushes for paid membership)

** Credit cards
*** Warning!
    Always pay credit cards back in full! They always charge above 8%-30% interest yearly!
    Do not accrue a single cent in interest!
    
    Most banks have a way to automatically repay the balance due, or at least the minimum payment due.
*** Issuer limits
    [[https://thepointsguy.com/guide/credit-card-application-restrictions][Some credit card companies have rules and restrictions that limit how many cards they'll issue you based on your recent history]]
**** Capital One
     [[https://cardrates.com/advice/how-many-capital-one-cards][Capital One limits the number of directly issued cards available for any cardholder to two]]
     and supposedly doesn't like giving credit cards to people that already have established credit
**** J. P. Morgan Chase
     Chase will only issue credit cards to people with less than 5 new credit cards in the past 24 months. 
     Therefore, others recommend getting enough credit to gain Chase's trust and then 
     apply for your desired Chase cards before applying for other credit cards. 
     Supposedly Chase wants to see you have at least one credit card with over a $5000 limit before giving you a credit card.
**** Premium companies
     Companies such as [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v=fJQD7mVK92w][Barclays]] supposedly won't issue credit cards to you if you don't use your existing credit cards from them or have too many total credit cards
**** American Express
     American Express supposedly limits the total number of cards you can have from them to 4-5, [[https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/maximum-number-of-american-express-cards-you-can-have][but this may have changed]]
*** High cash back

*** Secured
    Secured credit cards require a security deposit in order to open the account, usually equal to the credit limit you get. 
    However, this makes it extremely likely that you'll get approved for any that you apply for, 
    allowing you to build credit history if you're rejected from all other products. 
    Good issuers will refund the security deposit and upgrade you to a standard card after 6-12 months of timely payments. 
    
    Many issuers charge outrageous recurring or one-time fees, but there are some with good fee schedules. 
    The security deposit is onerous enough, there's no reason to pay more!

*** Opt in to the fast lane
    [[https://optoutprescreen.com][optoutprescreen.com]] lets you opt out of credit card offers in the mail. 
    However, there's a reason to opt IN to offers: 
    these pre-approval offers may not create a credit inquiry on your credit report if you use them to apply for the credit card / product. 
    Therefore, you could apply for dozens at once and suffer no negative credit impacts. 
    [[https://YouTube.com/watch?v=DwBWG3lm8TQ][The determining factor is supposedly whether or not you have to enter your full social security number when applying]]: 
    if the form only asks for the final 4 digits of your SSN, that's a sign it may come at no cost to your credit to apply. 
    
    [[https://CreditKarma.com][CreditKarma.com]] also says "See if you pre-qualify with no impact to your credit score", 
    and many of their recommendations / offers initially only require the last 4 digits of your SSN. 
    
    The determining factor is likely whether you are soliciting a creditor or the creditor is soliciting you: 
    an advertisement on a website or in the mail is initiated by the creditor, so they are more desperate to make a loan than you! 
    
    Valuable issuers like Chase are still likely to count these new credit lines against you, 
    and credit issuers reserve the right to deny your application if your credit report changes between when they send the offer and you actually apply, 
    so this is more of an advanced strategy. 
* Gift Cards
  Gift cards are less fungible than cash or bank credit: 
  they are tied to a single store. 
  This restriction is actually so limiting that that they can be purchased at a 15%-50% discount: 
  People would rather trade gift cards for half their value in cash in order to gain the ability to spend that cash in more than one place. 
  Prepaid debit cards are more fungible, but cards cost a fixed fee to open and some vendors charge 3%+ to process credit/debit transactions. 
  Both these types of cards don't earn interest while they hold any value, 
  which means that the company that issues them gets to enjoy the interest on unused currency. 

  Take advantage of how worthless gift cards are by buying them for 15%-50% off:

* Mobile Internet
  I value basic mobile data above all else, 
  as it's much more secure than the Public Switched Telephone Network 
  and more flexible to send an email than an SMS message, 
  plus you get web and streaming access. 

  These providers have unlimited 2G mobile data for as low as $15 per month! 
  - [[https://unrealmobile.com/?rfsn=5384968.64bd6a][Unreal Mobile]]: $15/month plan. GSM only
  - [[https://redpocket.com/?rfsn=5384968.64bd6a][Red Pocket]]: $20/month plan. GSM and CDMA

  [[https://freedompop.com/?rfsn=5384968.64bd6a][FreedomPop]] has a free plan but automatically charges $8 for data overage and $10 for a SIM card. Maybe useful as a backup. 
  Only 10 minutes of talk & 10 texts: truly basic. GSM only
* Corporations
  A Limited Liability Company (LLC) can assist you in lawsuits. 
  If an LLC is sued, only the assets owned by the LLC are at risk. 
  The owners or employees would have to be named in a seperate lawsuit to be liable. 
  Profit generated by an LLC flows through as income to the owners, 
  so income generated from assets given to an LLC can be collected but expenses and liabilities are limited to the total assets in the LLC. 

  A C Corporation can help you save on taxes if you're in the top income tax bracket: 
  Corporations pay a 20% tax on profit and individuals pay up to 15% on distributions. 
  Compared to the top income bracket of 37%, this saves at least 2% on taxes. 
  The real tax rate would be 1-(1-20%)*(1-15%) = 32%, which is currently equal to the third highest tax bracket on income over $163,300 for single individuals in 2020. 

  Otherwise, I know of no more rights or privileges that corporations have than a human being.
