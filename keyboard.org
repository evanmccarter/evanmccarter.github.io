#+TITLE: Keyboard Shortcuts
* Basics
  The <TAB> key can be used to cycle through elements you can interact with. 
  
  The <SPACE> or <ENTER> keys can be used to activate the selected element. The <ENTER> key does not perform other functions, but when a single element has multiple uses the <SPACE> key will more likely do the thing you want. 
  
  Here are some link elements to practice with: 
  
  [[..][Up one level]]
  
  [[./index.org][Index]]
