#+TITLE: Keyboard Shortcuts
* Operating System level
** Basics
   The <TAB> key can be used to cycle through elements you can interact with. 
   
   The <SPACE> or <ENTER> keys can be used to activate the selected element. The <ENTER> key does not perform other functions, but when a single element has multiple uses the <SPACE> key will more likely do the thing you want. 
   
   Here are some link elements to practice with: 
   
   [[..][Up one level]]
   
   [[./index.org][Index]]
   
   [[./keyboard.org][This page]]
   
   [[./finance.org][Personal Finance Resources]]

** Menus
   <ALT>+<SPACE> opens an accessibility menu for the current window, allowing you to move, resize, close, minimize, and (un)maximize the window with only the keyboard.
