    - IPFS is the InterPlanetary File System, software to share files peer-to-peer even when network size is limited
    - Messages are packaged into blocks that referenced a set of messages and a set of previous blocks. This forms a tree which can be used by clients to download messages referenced in blocks and discover further blocks
    - Blocks and messages are JSON objects, holding text or references to other files
    - Media was optionally encrypted and stored as base32 text, partitioned to meet plaintext size ceiling, and reassembled by the client while loading the message
