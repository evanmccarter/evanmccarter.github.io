    - Direct experience helping people with technical problems:
    basic computer usage,
    signing up for email accounts,
    navigating user programs (printing in word processor, using tabs in web browser)
* Projects
  - Bash shell utilities (Bash shell)
    - Find functions in source code without header comments (sed)
    - Find user’s SSH login information based on their name using key-value search (awk)
    - Easily and deterministically hash entire directories to detect changes (find, xargs)
    - Find disks with free space (df, sed, awk, lists in shell variables)
  - Taxi company simulator (C)
    - Simulated taxis picking up accumulating customers and delivering them to random destinations
    - Used structs, malloc, cohesive functions
  - Decentralized encrypted forum (Javascript, HTML, Node.js, CryptoJS)
    - Stores user-generated messages into a Decentralized Acyclic Graph tree stored on IPFS
    - IPFS is the InterPlanetary File System, software to share files peer-to-peer even when network size is limited
    - Messages are packaged into blocks that reference a set of messages and a set of previous blocks. This forms a tree which can be used by clients to download messages referenced in blocks and discover further blocks
    - Blocks and messages are JSON objects, holding text or references to other files
    - Media is optionally encrypted and stored as base32 text, partitioned to meet plaintext size ceiling, and reassembled by the client while loading the message
  - Assigning trust ratings to friends-of-friends using Markov chains and bitcoin transaction data (PHP, HTML)
    - Used linear algebra to calculate how closely groups of people (Bitcoin addresses) interact
    - Took negative opinion into account by reducing trust weights, potentially until negative
  - Bitcoin crowdfunding site (PHP, SQL, HTML)
    - Used PHP pages, SQL database, and Blockchain.info wallets to track funds donated and trigger payout
    - PHP pages enabled creating new campaigns and displaying campaign statuses
